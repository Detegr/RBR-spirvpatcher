# SPIR-V shader patcher utility for RBR

This little utility reads a SPIR-V fragment shader binary, disassembles it and adds [MultiView](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VK_KHR_multiview.html) support to the shader. Afterwards the shader is recompiled to binary again. This is by no means a generic approach, the library makes assumptions that are true for the DXVK generated SPIR-V shaders that Richard Burns Rally uses.
